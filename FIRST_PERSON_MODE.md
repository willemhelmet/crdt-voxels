# First-Person Mode Feature Specification

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the feature specification for a first-person mode in the collaborative voxel editor. This mode will allow users to enter a first-person perspective and navigate the voxel world they have created. This will provide a more immersive experience and allow users to explore their creations from a new perspective.

## 2. Core Features

### 2.1. Entering and Exiting First-Person Mode

- A new button will be added to the UI to toggle first-person mode.
- When a user enters first-person mode, the camera will transition from the current editor view to a first-person perspective.
- The user's avatar/camera will be positioned at a default starting point in the voxel world.
- When exiting first-person mode, the camera will return to the previous editor view.

### 2.2. First-Person Movement

- **Walking:** Users will be able to move forward, backward, left, and right using standard keyboard controls (e.g., WASD or arrow keys).
- **Jumping:** Users will be able to jump using a dedicated key (e.g., the space bar).
- **Collision Detection:** The user's movement will be constrained by the voxel world. Users will not be able to walk through voxels.
- **Gravity:** Gravity will be applied to the user, causing them to fall if they walk off a ledge.

### 2.3. Interaction with the Environment

- In the initial implementation, interaction with the environment (adding, deleting, or painting voxels) will be disabled in first-person mode. The focus will be on navigation and exploration.
- Future iterations may include the ability to interact with the environment from a first-person perspective.

## 3. Technical Requirements

### 3.1. State Management

- A new state will be added to the Zustand store to manage whether the application is in first-person mode.
- The user's position and orientation in first-person mode will also be managed in the store.

### 3.2. Camera Controls

- A new camera controller will be implemented for first-person mode. This will likely involve using a different camera setup in `react-three-fiber`.
- The camera will be attached to a "player" object that represents the user in the 3D scene.

### 3.3. Physics and Collision

- A physics engine (e.g., `react-three/rapier`) will be integrated to handle collision detection and gravity.
- The voxel grid will need to be represented as a physical object that the player can collide with.

### 3.4. Multiplayer Considerations

- Each user in a collaborative session will have their own avatar representing them in first-person mode.
- The position and orientation of each user's avatar will be synchronized across all clients in real-time.
- This will likely require storing the player's state in the Automerge document.

## 4. UI/UX

- A new icon will be added to the toolbar for entering first-person mode.
- When in first-person mode, the existing UI for editing tools may be hidden or replaced with a more minimal UI.
- A crosshair or other indicator may be displayed in the center of the screen to help with navigation.

## 5. Future Enhancements

- **Interaction:** Allow users to add, delete, and paint voxels from a first-person perspective.
- **Avatars:** Display customized avatars for each user.
- **Sound:** Add sound effects for walking, jumping, and other interactions.
